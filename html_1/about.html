                <h2> About Us - Waterbury Church of God 7th Day</h2>
                <p>
                    At Waterbury Church of God 7th Day, we are a Christ-centered, Bible-believing community dedicated 
                    to worshiping God, serving others, and growing in faith together. Located in the heart of Waterbury, 
                    Connecticut, our church family gathers every Sabbath to celebrate God's goodness, study His Word, 
                    and build one another up through fellowship and prayer. We believe in the power of the Holy Spirit, 
                    the importance of community, and the hope found in Jesus Christ. Whether you're seeking a place to 
                    grow spiritually, serve with purpose, or simply connect, we welcome you with open arms. 
                    Come as you are â€” there's a place for you here. 
                </p>
